# youtube

To run our code:
1. install node js
2. clone the repository
3. navigate to the "web" folder in the terminal
4. use command npm start

workflow:
we first divided the required pages between us, one did the sign up/login pages,  while the other did the home page/video upload/video watch pages (we switched the pages for the android part)
each one designed his pages to look as close as possible to the real youtube, while using libraries like bootstrap
we then added logic to check the users sign up information, and login info, added the ability to add videos,comments and edit/delete those (only the user who uploaded the video/comment can delete them), and finally we gave the users the option to search for videos and switch between dark and light mode.
